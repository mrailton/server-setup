# Server Setup

Script used to set up my own servers for my main use cases.

Note: This should only be run once on a new server as may cause issues if run more than once or on a server that's already in use.

## Installation
1. Run `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrailton/server-setup/main/install.sh | sh`.
